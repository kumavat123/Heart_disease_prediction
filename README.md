🩺 Disease Predictor Bootcamp – DevTown x Microsoft x Google
 📖 Overview

This repository documents my journey and project from the **5-Day Disease Predictor Bootcamp** organized by **DevTown** in collaboration with **Microsoft** and **Google**.

During this bootcamp, I built an **AI-powered disease prediction model** from scratch — learning the full pipeline of **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment**.

The bootcamp was designed for beginners but delivered **industry-level insights** into how AI can transform **healthcare predictions and diagnostics**.
